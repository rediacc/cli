# CLI Wrapper Refactoring

## Overview

The `cli_wrapper.py` mock execution logic has been refactored to use a cleaner, more maintainable approach with JSON configuration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `mock_config.json`
- Centralized entity definitions with their properties
- Defined command patterns and response templates
- Configured error responses
- Made it easy to add new entity types without code changes

### 2. Created `mock_handler.py`
- Separated mock logic from CLI wrapper
- Cleaner command parsing
- Template-based response generation
- Automatic entity tracking and relationship validation

### 3. Simplified `cli_wrapper.py`
- Removed 200+ lines of complex string parsing
- Replaced with simple delegation to MockHandler
- Much easier to understand and maintain

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Add new entities by updating JSON, not code
2. **Consistency**: All entities follow same patterns
3. **Validation**: Built-in support for required fields and relationships
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new command types or validations
5. **Debugging**: Clear separation of concerns

## Example: Adding a New Entity

Before (in cli_wrapper.py):
```python
elif 'create newentity' in cmd_str or entity_type == 'newentity':
    # 20+ lines of parsing and response building
    # Copy-pasted from other entities
    # Easy to miss fields or make mistakes
```

After (in mock_config.json):
```json
"newentity": {
  "singular": "newentity",
  "plural": "newentities",
  "id_prefix": "newentity",
  "required_params": ["name", "team"],
  "default_values": {
    "status": "active"
  },
  "response_fields": ["id", "name", "team", "status"],
  "verify_fields": ["team", "status"]
}
```

## Usage

The mock handler automatically:
- Validates entity names (alphanumeric + dash + underscore)
- Checks required fields
- Verifies entity relationships exist
- Generates appropriate IDs
- Tracks created entities for retrieval
- Provides consistent error messages

## Future Improvements

1. Add support for custom validators per entity type
2. Support for more complex relationships
3. Mock data persistence between test runs
4. Performance metrics in mock mode
