"""
Setup script with protocol registration hooks for Windows.

This file exists for compatibility with legacy tools that expect setup.py.
All package configuration is now in pyproject.toml, but we add custom
install/uninstall commands for protocol registration.

Modern installations should use:
    pip install .
or
    python -m build

Instead of:
    python setup.py install  # deprecated
    python setup.py develop  # deprecated
