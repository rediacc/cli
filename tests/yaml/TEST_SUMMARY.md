# Rediacc CLI Test Suite Summary

## Completed Work

### 1. Test Infrastructure
- ✅ Created YAML-based test runner (`run_tests.py`)
- ✅ Automatic output filename generation
- ✅ Command metadata capture in results
- ✅ Consolidated test results per file
- ✅ Execution timing information
- ✅ Coverage reporting
- ✅ Variable substitution with config and chain context
- ✅ Stdin support for vault operations
- ✅ Hierarchical test execution for subscription plans

### 2. Basic Tests (Community Edition)
- ✅ **00010_company_setup.yaml** - Company creation and activation
- ✅ **00020_team_management.yaml** - Team CRUD operations
- ✅ **00030_user_management.yaml** - User creation and management
- ✅ **00031_user_password_management.yaml** - Password management
- ✅ **00040_permission_management.yaml** - Permission operations (fails on Community)
- ✅ **00050_machine_management.yaml** - Machine creation and management
- ✅ **00060_bridge_region_management.yaml** - Region and bridge management
- ✅ **00070_repository_management.yaml** - Repository operations
- ✅ **00080_queue_operations.yaml** - Queue item creation and listing
- ✅ **09999_logout.yaml** - Cleanup and logout

### 3. Advanced Tests (Paid Plans)
- ✅ **00010.1_company_setup_advanced.yaml** - Company with ADVANCED plan
- ✅ **00031.2_user_tfa_management.yaml** - TFA documentation
- ✅ **00040.1_permission_management_advanced.yaml** - Custom permission groups
- ✅ **00050.1_storage_management.yaml** - Storage resources (Advanced+)
- ✅ **00060.1_schedule_management.yaml** - Scheduled tasks (Premium+)

### 4. Configuration and Documentation
- ✅ Updated `config.yaml` with all test data patterns
- ✅ Created comprehensive README.md
- ✅ Added subscription plan support to CLI

## Known Issues

### 1. Test Dependencies
- Machine tests require `chain.team_name` from team management test
- Tests must run in numerical order for proper chain context
- Some tests fail due to missing prerequisites

### 2. Community Edition Limitations
- Permission group creation fails (requires paid plan)
- Storage creation fails (requires Advanced+)
- Schedule creation fails (requires Premium+)

### 3. Backend Issues
- `UpdateUserPassword` stored procedure missing
- Some connection reset errors during testing

## Test Coverage Summary
- **Commands**: 11/93 tested (11.8%)
- **Stored Procedures**: 10/84 tested (11.9%)

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Test Dependencies**
   - Ensure all tests can run independently or document dependencies
   - Consider adding setup sections to tests that need prerequisites

2. **Create Premium/Elite Tests**
   - Premium: Advanced features + schedules
   - Elite: All features + enterprise capabilities

3. **Add More Test Cases**
   - Audit operations
   - Distributed storage
   - Workflow management
   - License management
   - Error handling tests

4. **Improve Test Stability**
   - Handle connection errors gracefully
   - Add retry logic for flaky tests
   - Better error messages for debugging

## Usage

```bash
# Run all basic tests
./run_tests.py "basic/*.yaml"

# Run advanced tests (includes basic)
./run_tests.py "advanced/*.yaml"

# Run specific test
./run_tests.py "basic/00010_company_setup.yaml"

# View test results
ls test_results/test_*/
```

## Notes

- Tests use `--output json-full` for comprehensive data capture
- Chain context allows data sharing between test files
- Hierarchical execution ensures proper test order
- Coverage report shows which CLI commands and API endpoints are tested
