# Test Scripts Update Summary

All test scripts have been updated to work with the new token management system. Here's what was changed:

## Common Updates Applied to All Scripts

1. **Token Management**
   - All scripts now accept token as a parameter or use `REDIACC_TOKEN` environment variable
   - Removed dependencies on `.env` files and login/logout operations
   - Added clear error messages when token is not provided

2. **Error Handling**
   - Added consistent error handling pattern using colored output (green ✓, red ✗, yellow ⚠)
   - Scripts continue execution even when some tests fail (no longer exit on first error)
   - Added informative messages about why tests might fail

3. **Infrastructure Checks**
   - Added notes about required infrastructure (machines, repositories)
   - Scripts now handle cases where infrastructure might not exist
   - Better error messages indicate when failures are due to missing infrastructure

## Script-Specific Updates

### test-simple.sh
- Added proper error handling and status messages
- Made test file names unique with timestamps
- Added infrastructure availability notes

### test-quick.sh
- Added comprehensive error handling for all test operations
- Improved cleanup to handle dynamic directory names
- Added status indicators for each test operation

### test-dev-mode.sh
- Added infrastructure existence checks
- Improved error messages for failed operations
- Added notes about when infrastructure might be missing

### test-sync.sh
- Removed dependency on system admin credentials
- Simplified infrastructure verification using direct connection tests
- Improved error handling for invalid resources
- Removed logout operation (not needed with token auth)

### test-full-api.sh
- Removed dependency on admin credentials and .env file
- Added warnings for operations that require special permissions
- Improved error handling for infrastructure creation
- Replaced logout test with invalid token test

## Usage Examples

All scripts now follow the same pattern:

```bash
# Using command line parameter
./test-simple.sh YOUR_TOKEN_HERE

# Using environment variable
export REDIACC_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
./test-simple.sh

# With development mode (relaxed SSH checking)
./test-dev-mode.sh YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

## Infrastructure Requirements

Most tests assume the following infrastructure exists:
- Machine: `rediacc11`
- Repository: `A1`

If these don't exist, tests will show appropriate error messages but continue running other tests.

## Notes

1. All scripts now use `set -e` for proper error propagation
2. Color output helps quickly identify successful vs failed operations
3. Scripts provide helpful messages about why tests might fail
4. Cleanup operations are more robust with unique timestamps
